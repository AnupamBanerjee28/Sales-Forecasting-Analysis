# Sales-Forecasting-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **Sales Forecasting** using **time series analysis** to predict future sales based on historical data.  
The model helps businesses identify trends, seasonality, and growth opportunities for better decision-making.

---

## Objectives

- Predict future sales using historical sales data.
- Identify seasonality and trend patterns in sales.
- Compare model performance between **SARIMA**.
- Provide clear, data-driven insights through visualizations.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization  
  - `statsmodels` – SARIMA modeling  
  - `scikit-learn` – Model evaluation metrics  

---

## Process

1. **Data Collection:** Imported historical sales data from CSV files.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, formatted, and handled missing values.  
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Visualized sales trends, rolling means, and seasonality.  
4. **Modeling:**  
   - Built and tuned **SARIMA** 
   - Captured both simple and complex seasonal effects.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Calculated **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE** to assess forecast accuracy.  
6. **Forecasting:** Generated 12-month future sales forecasts with clear trend visualization.

## Results

- Successfully forecasted sales for future periods with high accuracy.  
- Visualizations highlight clear seasonal and trend patterns.  
- Provided actionable insights for sales planning and strategy.

## Visual Output Examples

- Historical vs Forecasted Sales Plots  
- Rolling Mean & Trend Analysis  

---

## Key Takeaways

- SARIMA performs well on stationary series.  
- Combining both approaches improves reliability and interpretability.
